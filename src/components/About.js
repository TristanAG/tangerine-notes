    <p>You can use e c c o n o t e to make sure your notes, thoughts, or ideas don't get lost in the ether. My goal is to create a note app where whenever you have a thought, you can quickly write it down, and #tag it with relevant #hashtags to reference in the future</p>

    <p>I seem to have all kinds of ideas in my head, and a strong urge to write them down, <i>but I rarely revisit them.</i> The goal with e c c o n o t e is to create a dynamic system that allows you to play with your ideas and thoughts, observe trends in what you're thinking / writing about (by viewing frequency of #hashtags) Or writing a note, and realizing that you already had a profound insight from a few weeks back.</p>

    <p>my aim with this system is to provide a reliable and functional place to write, store, and reference my notes without the need to organize things up front. Just write, tag, store, reflect. As you write your notes and tag them, ecconote will classify what your note is about and all the relevant content you've previously written around that hashtag.</p>
    <p>write a lot and #tag often!</p>
