        The app should allow you to very simply record your thoughts, jot them down quickly with tags, however you choose, and be able to have them echoed back to you whenever you want that info. <br />It's an interface for abstracting your thoughts and finding ways of making connections.<br/>I thnk that the app should ecco back your latest hashtags, but also find ways of reminding you what you're focused on.<br />
        it's a way of abstracting your thoughts out. <br/>
        so the interface should be super minimal. like, really minimal.<br/>
        whenever you log in, you see
        the hashtag list will just be the latest things that you've entered, and it will only display a certain amount... you can specify the amount in config if you choose! but something else super cool is that I see the idea of building a native app type
